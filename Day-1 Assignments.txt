Day-1: Assignments:
1. Write a python program that prints “hello world” as an output.  
2. Given two numbers num1 and num2. The task is to write a Python program to find the addition of these two numbers. 
3. Write a python program to Add two number provided by user input. 
4. Write a python program to check input data type. Take input from user.  
5. Demonstrate string literals i.e., single(”), double(“”), or triple quotes in python. 
6. Write a python program which takes two numbers from user and perform the following arithmetic operations  

+	Addition: adds two operands	x + y 

–	Subtraction: subtracts two operands	x – y 

*	Multiplication: multiplies two operands	x * y 

/	Division (float): divides the first operand by the second	x / y 

//	Division (floor): divides the first operand by the second	x // y 

%	Modulus: returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second	x % y 

**	 Power: Returns first raised to power second	x ** y. 

7. Write a Python code to demonstrate working of  - add(), sub(), mul(). (take inputs from user) 
8. Write a python code to create a variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display the result. 
9.Write a Python code to demonstrate working of   truediv(), floordiv(), pow(), mod() 
10. Write a Python program to show use of  +  and  *  operator for different purposes.
