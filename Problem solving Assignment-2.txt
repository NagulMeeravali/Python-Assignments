19. WAP to accept  string and find longest word in a given string. 

20. WAP to accept N values and find max and second max value, min and second min value.

21. WAP to accept a positive number N and calculate M= 2N (2 raised to power N). and calculate the sum of digits of M till we gets single digit number.

Sample input:

Enter N value:  6

Expected output: 1

Explanation:  

   If N=6 then M= 26  ==> 64

Here 64 is not a single digit, so we need to do sum:  6+4==> 10  ==>  1+0===> 1,

M=1
